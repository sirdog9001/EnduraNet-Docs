Welcome to the documentation site for EnduraNet. This serves as the central repository for all information pertinent to the application.

The site is broken down into 5 major sections.

- *Viewing Data* goes over navigating the site to search for existing information.
- *Editing Data* goes over logging in and using input forms to manipulate information. 
- *Access Control* breaks down the permissions system and how EnduraNet handles who can do what.
- *Code* is all about internal code documentation to help those with access to the GitHub repository.
- *Release Notes* is self-explanatory.
