*Flagged persons* is a feature introduced in `v1.2.0` which blocks attempts to add members based on name, Discord ID, or Steam ID. Blocked identifiers are stored on a private database table.

Flagging a person is done by <abbr title="Endurance Coalition">EDC</abbr> leadership. The reason for someone being flagged can vary. Some may be flagged for egregious behavior to prevent them ever joining. Others may be flagged because a specific staff member *really* wants to be the one to add them.

Generally speaking, the reason as to why any individual person is flagged is confidential.

Attempts to add a flagged person will result in an alert being displayed similar to what is shown above. Simply follow it's instructions and move on.
