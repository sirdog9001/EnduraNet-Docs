Access to EnduraNet is determined by Discord account. Simply click the "Login with Discord" button at the top right and authorize EnduraNet's access.

For full transparency, Discord's API provides the following to the application:

- Your Discord username.
- Your Discord ID.
- Your Discord profile avatar.
- The 2-factor authentication status of your account.

The end result should be seeing a new red tab (or tabs), your Discord information at the top right, and a bright logout button.

If you received an "access denied" pop-up it means you have not been assigned [any permissions](../permissions.md) by an EnduraNet administrator.
