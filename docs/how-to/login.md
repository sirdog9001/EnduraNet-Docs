??? info "Information Transparency"
    Discord's API gives EnduraNet the following information:

    - Discord username.
    - Discord ID.
    - Avatar.
    - Account 2FA status. 

Logging into EnduraNet is done to perform some kind of data manipulation; viewing can be done by any visitor. Not *all* members have the ability to login. If you try to do so and get an "access denied" message it means an administrator has not given you any [permissions](../guides/permissions.md).

To login, click the "Login with Discord" button at the top right of the interface. You will be asked to authorize information.

Once you are done you should be back at the `members.php` page. The "Login with Discord" button should be replaced with your Discord information, a red logout button should be visible to the right of that, and the tab *Data Management* should be visible.
