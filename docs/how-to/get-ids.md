## Discord ID
!!! info
    - You can check that the number you have is *actually* a Discord ID by using the [Discord.id](https://discord.id) website.
    - **A Discord ID is not the same as a username**. Usernames, while more unique after the [2023 update](https://discord.com/blog/usernames), are still changeable. Discord IDs cannot be changed and are the standard for account identification.

To get a Discord ID, do the following:

1. Click the `User Settings` cog to the right of the `Mute` and `Deafen` icons.
2. Click `Advanced` under the *App Settings* list.
3. Check `Developer Mode`.
4. Exit user settings.
5. Find any message which has been sent by the user in question.
6. Right click their *name*.
7. Select option `Copy User ID`.
8. Done.

An example of a proper Discord ID is `137356883664175104`.

## Steam ID
!!! info
    Steam IDs come in 2 different formats: x64 (`76561197970909251`) and x32 (`STEAM_0:0:47830396`). 
    
    **EnduraNet needs the x64 variant**.

To get a Steam ID, do the following:

1. Navigate to the Steam profile of the person either in your browser or in the Steam app.
    1. There should be a URL that looks like: `https://steamcommunity.com/id/<stuff>`.
2. The `<stuff>` should either be a number (usually beginning with `765`) or some kind of user-set name.
    1. If it's the number, **that is the ID**. Copy that. You may skip the remainder of the steps.
    2. If it's not a number, go to step 3.
3. Copy the entire URL.
4. Go to [SteamID.io](https://steamid.io/lookup/).
5. Paste the entire URL into the `input...` bar and click "lookup".
6. Copy the `steamID64` field.
7. Done.

An example of a proper Steam ID is `76561197970909251`.
