    The *Certification History* tab is not designed to display whether a member's status on a certification is valid. See [Check Certification Status](check-cert-status.md) to learn how to do that.

Searching someone's certification history can be done at the *Certification History* tab. The search bar can find information on any column. 

The **UID** column to the far left is the unique database identifier of the record in question. This is used to select records for [editing](edit-history.md) or [deletion](delete-history.md). Clicking the "Copy UID" button in the far right column will quickly copy the number to your clipboard.
