    All features on this roadmap are subject to change. Some features may or may not be implemented based on feedback.

The following are the remaining *major features* anticipated for EnduraNet. Once implemented EnduraNet will be considered *feature-complete*. Further development will focus on maintenance, security patches, small-to-medium features at the request of the community, and code-base refactoring.

-   :fontawesome-solid-calendar-days: __Operations Tracking__

    ---

    This would include:
    
    - The name, date, and start time of the operation.
    - Who created the operation.
    - All members who attended the operation.
    - What roles each member had in the operation.

    This would be a major addition involving new permissions (e.g `can_add_operation`), new data viewing tabs, and a custom grid-like viewing form to review operation data.

-    :fontawesome-solid-folder: __Member Dossiers__

    ---
    Allow EDC leadership to create private notes on members in the community with strict viewing-permissions. This could be used to document poor behavior, exceptional actions in an operation, and anything in-between.

-    :fontawesome-solid-file-pdf: __Report Generation__

    ---
   As of `v1.2.0` it is possible to look up information on *one member at a time*. This is obviously inefficent for Zeuses, who more regularly need to check *several* certification statuses at the same time.<br/><br/>It is planned to have a report generation feature so Zeuses can select a *batch* of members and get a consolidated report of every certification that is valid. Report generation could also go beyond certifications depending on what other features are added.
